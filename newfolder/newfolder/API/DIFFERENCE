Q. Write the differnce between soap and restful web servvice?
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), a W3C recommendation for communication between two applications
SOAP is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services over HTTP
Any Web Service that complies and follows some guidelines which are led down by SOAP Web Services specifications is a SOAP Web Service.




REST (REpresentational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style
REST is not a protocol,
there are no strict specifications,
no central body like W3C to control specifications
REST is a design principle, one can use design principles/methods to create a service, which creates RESTful Web Services


There are many differences between SOAP and REST web services, some important differences are given below:

SOAP Web Services/API	                                                                REST Web Services/API
                                                                   
SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol	                                        REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer
SOAP is a protocol	                                                                REST is an architectural style
SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol but REST is an architectural pattern	   REST can use SOAP web services as it is an architectural pattern/concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP
SOAP uses service interfaces to expose the business logic	                           REST uses URI (URL path) to expose business logic
SOAP requires more bandwidth and resource than REST	                                  REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP
SOAP is slow as compared to REST	                                                    REST is fast as compared to SOAP
SOAP permits XML data format only	                                                    REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, JSON, XML etc.
SOAP is less preferred than REST	                                                    REST IS more preferred than SOAP



Q. What are http methods?
HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other methods, too, but they are utilized less frequently.
